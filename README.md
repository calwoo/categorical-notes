## Notes on categorical structures in Haskell.

These are a collection of some notes on category theory collected from various sources. Sometimes I learn something new about category theory this way.

### things I've learned recently (sorry if this is newbish!)

Language pragmas are important for extending GHC. So far I've used `PolyKinds`, `TypeOperators`, `MultiParamTypeClasses`, `RankNTypes`.

Yoneda's lemma could be rephrased as saying the right Kan extension of a functor along the identity is itself.
